About Sesame
------------

Sesame is a Python3 package for solving the drift diffusion Poisson equations for
multi-dimensional systems using finite differences.

The software computes the steady state of a semiconductor between two contacts,
and subject to voltage bias and/or illumination. It was developed to study
polycrystalline solar cells containing charged interfaces (grain boundaries,
sample surface). Sesame handles single charged states and continuum of defect
states alike.
