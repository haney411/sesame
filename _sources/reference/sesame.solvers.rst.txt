:mod:`sesame.solvers` -- Equilibrium and nonequilibrium solvers
===============================================================

Sesame offers several solvers to address quickly specific problems (equilibrium
potential, IV curve) without having to manage a cumbersome machinery to get to
the solution.

:mod:`sesame.solvers.default` -- Default solver
-----------------------------------------------

The functions below belong to the default solver `sesame.solvers.default` which
is created upon loading sesame. We made these functions available once sesame is
loaded making the solver completely transparent for the user (e.g. one can call
`sesame.solve_equilibrium`). The solver stores the equilibrium potential of the
system as soon as it has been computed.

Creating  another solver
------------------------

Making another solver is done by creating an instance of the
`sesame.solvers.Solver` class. This can be used to turn off the use of the MUMPS
library even when the library is available.
