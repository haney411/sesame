Tutorial 5: Simulating an EBIC/CL experiment
---------------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial we build a 2-dimensional simulation to describe experiments with a localized carrier generation profile, such as electron beam induced current (EBIC), or cathodoluminescence (CL). 

.. seealso:: The example treated here is in the file ``2d_EBIC.py`` located in the ``examples\tutorial5`` directory of the distribution.  The same simulation's GUI input file is ``2d_EBIC.ini``, also located in the ``examples\tutorial5`` directory.


For this case we'll need to define a system as before, and then define a custom carrier generation rate density profile associated with electron beam excitation.  We'll then cycle over beam positions and compute the total current and total radiative recombination as a function of beam position.

Building the system
........................

The system we want to build is a 2-dimensional p-n junction in which the "top" of the system represents the exposed sample surface.  Building the 2-d pn junction proceeds as in the previous tutorials, and the code is shown below::


    	## dimensions of the system
	Lx = 3e-4   #[cm]
	Ly = 3e-4   #[cm]
	
	# extent of the junction from the left contact [cm]
	junction = .1e-4    # [cm]
	
	# Mesh
	x = np.concatenate((np.linspace(0,.2e-4, 30, endpoint=False),
	                    np.linspace(0.2e-4, 1.4e-4, 60, endpoint=False),
	                    np.linspace(1.4e-4, 2.7e-4, 60, endpoint=False),
	                    np.linspace(2.7e-4, Lx, 10)))
	
	y = np.concatenate((np.linspace(0, .25e-4, 50, endpoint=False),
	                    np.linspace(.25e-4, 1.25e-4, 50, endpoint=False),
	                    np.linspace(1.25e-4, Ly, 50)))
	
	# Create a system
	sys = sesame.Builder(x, y)
	
	# Dictionary with the material parameters
	mat = {'Nc':8e17, 'Nv':1.8e19, 'Eg':1.5, 'epsilon':9.4, 'Et': 0,
	       'mu_e':320, 'mu_h':40, 'tau_e':10*1e-9, 'tau_h':10*1e-9}
	
	# Add the material to the system
	sys.add_material(mat)
	
	# define a function specifiying the n-type region
	def n_region(pos):
	    x, y = pos
	    return x < junction
	# define a function specifiying the p-type region
	def p_region(pos):
	    x, y = pos
	    return x >= junction
	
	# Add the donors
	nD = 1e17 # [cm^-3]
	sys.add_donor(nD, n_region)
	# Add the acceptors
	nA = 1e15 # [m^-3]
	sys.add_acceptor(nA, p_region)
	
	# Use Ohmic contacts
	sys.contact_type('Ohmic','Ohmic')
	Sn_left, Sp_left, Sn_right, Sp_right = 1e7, 1e7, 1e7, 1e7
	sys.contact_S(Sn_left, Sp_left, Sn_right, Sp_right)
	


Adding surface recombination
............................

Adding recombination at the sample surface is accomplished with a planar defect along the line :math:`y=L_y`.  We consider a neutral surface, so that the charge state of the defect is always 0.  This is implemented by setting ``transition=(0,0)`` as an input argument to ``add_line_defects()``.  As described in the previous tutorial, the values given in ``transition`` set the charge of the defect when its occupied or unoccupied:: 

    p1 = (0, Ly)
    p2 = (Lx, Ly)

    E = 0                   # energy of gap state (eV) from intrinsic level
    rhoGB = 1e14            # density of defect states [cm^-2]
    s = 1e-14               # defect capture cross section [cm^2]

    sys.add_line_defects([p1, p2], rhoGB, s, E=E, transition=(0,0))

Electron beam excitation
............................

Next we review the physics of the electron beam excitation.  For a beam focused at :math:`(x_0,y_0)`, a simple parameterization of the generation rate density profile is given by a Gaussian:

.. math:: 
   G(x,y) &= \frac{G_{\rm tot}}{A} \times \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) 
   :label: Gxy 

For our geometry, :math:`~x_0` is the lateral beam position, while the depth of the excitation from the sample surface is :math:`y_0`.  The total generation rate (units :math:`1/s`) is approximated by [4]_:

.. math::
   G_{tot} &\approx \frac{I_{\rm beam}}{q} \times \frac{E_{\rm beam}}{3 E_g}
   :label: A

The length scale of the excitation :math:`\sigma` is determined by the electron beam energy and material mass density, and is written in terms of the interaction distance :math:`R_B`:

.. math::
   R_B &= r_0 \left(\frac{0.043}{\rho/\rho_0}\right) \times \left(E_{\rm beam} /E_0\right)^{1.75}
   :label: Rb

The constants in Eq. :eq:`Rb` are :math:`r_0=1~{\rm \mu m},~\rho_0=1~{\rm g/cm^3},~E_0=1~{\rm keV}`.  The length scale of the Guassian :math:`\sigma` and the distance from the surface :math:`y_0` are related to :math:`R_B` as [5]_:

.. math::
   \sigma &= \frac{R_B}{\sqrt{15}}\\
   y_0 &= 0.3\times R_B


The normalization constant :math:`A` has units of volume.  The standard normalization of a 2-dimensional Gaussian is :math:`2\pi\sigma^2`, which has units of area.  An appropriate choice for the additional length factor in :math:`A` is the electron diffusion length :math:`L_D`, so that:

.. math::
   A &= 2\pi\sigma^2 L_D
   :label: norm
  
To code :math:`G(x,y)`, Eq. :eq:`Gxy` we start by making the necessary definitions of constants::

	q = 1.6e-19      # C
	Ibeam = 10e-12   # A
	Ebeam = 15e3     # eV
	eg = 1.5         # eV
	density = 5.85   # g/cm^3
	kev = 1e3        # eV
	
	Gtot = Ibeam/q * Ebeam / (3*eg)			
	Rbulb = 0.043 / density * (Ebeam/kev)**1.75 	# given in micron
	Rbulb = Rbulb * 1e-4  				# converting to cm
	
	sigma = Rbulb / sqrt(15)		 	# Gaussian spread
	y0 = 0.3 * Rbulb				# penetration depth

	Ld = np.sqrt(sys.mu_e[0] * sys.tau_e[0]) * sys.scaling.length  # diffusion length



Perfoming the beam scan
........................

To scan the lateral position :math:`x_0` of the beam, we first define the list of :math:`x_0` values::

	x0list = np.linspace(.1e-4, 2.5e-4, 11)

We define an array to store the computed current at each beam position::

	jset = np.zeros(len(x0list))
	
Next we scan over :math:`x_0` with a ``for`` loop.  At each value of :math:`x_0`, we define a function as given in Eq. :eq:`Gxy`, and add this generation to the system::

	for idx, x0 in enumerate(x0list):

	    def excitation(x,y):
	        return Gtot/(2*np.pi*sigma**2*Ld) * 
                   np.exp(-(x-x0)**2/(2*sigma**2)) * np.exp(-(y-Ly+y0)**2/(2*sigma**2))
	
	    sys.generation(excitation)

.. note::
    Using the GUI is more awkward for this type of simulation, because only one variable definition is allowed in the generation function definition.  Therefore all of the numerical prefactors must be computed by the user and input by hand.
	
Now we solve the system::

	    solution = sesame.solve(sys, periodic_bcs=False)

Notice that we provided the optional input argument ``periodic_bcs=False`` to the ``solve()`` function.  This ensures that the top and bottom boundary conditions are "hardwall".  The default boundary condition is periodic, such that :math:`f(x,y=0)=f(x,y=L)` for all system properties.


We obtain the current and store it in the array::
	
	    # get analyzer object with which to compute the current
	    az = sesame.Analyzer(sys, solution)
	    # compute (dimensionless) current and convert to dimension-ful form
	    tj = az.full_current() * sys.scaling.current * sys.scaling.length
	    # save the current
	    jset[idx] = tj


It can be informative to plot the current normalized to the total generation rate.  The (dimensionless) total generation rate for a simulation is contained in the ``gtot`` field of ``sys``.  As always, we must use ``scaling`` factors to make this a dimension-ful quantity.  The code for this is shown below::

    # obtain total generation from sys object
    gtot = sys.gtot * sys.scaling.generation * sys.scaling.length**2
    jratio[idx] = tj/(q * gtot)


We can also compute the radiative recombination at each beam position point, thereby simulation a cathodoluminesence experiment.  This code shown below::

  # compute (dimensionless) total radiative recombination and convert to to   dimension-ful form
  cl = az.integrated_radiative_recombination() * sys.scaling.generation *   sys.scaling.length**2
  # save the CL
  rset[idx] = cl
  rad_ratio[idx] = cl/gtot


The current and CL can be saved and plotted as in previous tutorials.
