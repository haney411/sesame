Tutorial 3: Two-dimensional *pn* junction with a grain boundary
---------------------------------------------------------------
In this tutorial we show how to build a two-dimensional :math:`pn^{+}` junction containing a
grain boundary. 

.. seealso:: The example treated here is in the file ``2d_homojunction_withGB.py`` located in the
   ``examples\tutorial3`` directory in the root directory of the distribution.  The same simulation's GUI input file is ``2d_homojunction_withGB.ini``, also located in the ``examples\tutorial3`` directory.


Building a two-dimensional system
.................................
We want to simulate a two-dimensional :math:`pn^{+}` junction (homojunction) with a
columnar grain boundary as depicted below.  

.. image:: geometry.*
   :align: center

As usual, we start by importing the sesame and numpy packages. We construct the
mesh of the system and make an instance of the :func:`~sesame.builder.Builder`.  Notice that in this case we provide the :func:`~sesame.builder.Builder` function with both x and y grids; this automatically tells the code to build a two-dimensional system::

    import sesame
    import numpy as np

    # dimensions of the system
    Lx = 3e-4 # [cm]
    Ly = 3e-4 # [cm]

    # position of p-n junction [cm]
    junction = .1e-4 

    # Mesh
    x = np.concatenate((np.linspace(0, .2e-4, 30, endpoint=False),      # mesh near the contact
                    np.linspace(0.2e-4, 1.4e-4, 50, endpoint=False),    # mesh in depletion region
                    np.linspace(1.4e-4, 2.7e-4, 50, endpoint=False),    # mesh in bulk
                    np.linspace(2.7e-4, 2.98e-4, 30, endpoint=False),   # mesh near the GB end point
                    np.linspace(2.98e-4, Lx, 10)))     	              # mesh near the contact

    y = np.concatenate((np.linspace(0, 1.25e-4, 50, endpoint=False),
                    np.linspace(1.25e-4, 1.75e-4, 50, endpoint=False),  # mesh near the GB core
                    np.linspace(1.75e-4, Ly, 50)))

    # Create a system
    sys = sesame.Builder(x, y)

We define and add a material as before::

    # Dictionary with the material parameters
    mat = {'Nc':8e17, 'Nv':1.8e19, 'Eg':1.5, 'affinity': 3.9, 'epsilon':9.4,
            'mu_e':200, 'mu_h':200, 'tau_e':10e-9, 'tau_h':10e-9, 'Et':0}

    # Add the material to the system
    sys.add_material(mat)

We next define functions delimiting the regions with different doping values. Because the model is 2-dimensional, the function input argument ``pos`` is a ``tuple`` of the form ``(x,y)``.  In the functions below, we first "unpack" the x and y coordinate, and determine the location of the x-coordinate relative to the junction::

    # Add the donors
    def n_region(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return x < junction

    nD = 1e17  # [cm^-3]
    sys.add_donor(nD, n_region)

    # Add the acceptors
    def p_region(pos):
        x, y = pos
        return x >= junction    

    nA = 1e15  # [cm^-3]
    sys.add_acceptor(nA, p_region)

We specify contacts as before::


    # Use perfectly selective Ohmic contacts
    sys.contact_type('Ohmic', 'Ohmic')
    Sn_left, Sp_left, Sn_right, Sp_right = 1e7, 0, 0, 1e7
    sys.contacts(Sn_left, Sp_left, Sn_right, Sp_right)

.. note::
    Sesame assumes that the contact properties (e.g. recombination velocity, metallic work function) are uniform along the y-direction.

Adding a grain boundary
.......................

Now we add a line of defects to simulate a grain boundary using the ``sys`` method :func:`~sesame.builder.Builder.add_line_defects`.  The necessary inputs are the grain boundary defect's electrical properties (e.g. capture cross sections, energy level, defect density, and charge states), and the endpoints defining the grain boundary location (recall a grain boundary is represented by a line in a 2-dimensional simulation).  Below we show code defining these properties for our example, and adding the grain boundary to the simulation::

    # gap state characteristics
    rho_GB = 1e14               # defect density [1/cm^2]
    S_GB = 1e-15                # trap capture cross section [cm^2]
    E_GB = 0.4                  # energy of gap state (eV) from intrinsic energy level
    

    # Specify the two points that make the line containing additional charges
    p1 = (.1e-4, 1.5e-4)   # [cm]
    p2 = (2.9e-4, 1.5e-4)  # [cm]

    # Add the line of defects to the system
    sys.add_line_defects([p1, p2], rho_GB, S_GB, E=E_GB, transition=(1/-1))

The type of the charge transition :math:`\alpha/\beta` is specified by assigning the ``transition`` input value as
shown above. In our example we chose a mixture of donor and acceptor at energy
E. An acceptor would be described by (-1,0) and a donor by (1,0).

.. note::
   * Avoid adding charges on the contacts of the system, as these will not be
     taken into account. The code is not equiped to deal with such boundary
     conditions.
   * In order to add another gap state at a different energy at the same
     location, one repeats the exact same process.  
   * Here we assumed equal electron and hole surface recombination velocities.
     The function :func:`~sesame.builder.Builder.add_line_defects` takes two
     surface recombination velocities as argument. The first is for electrons,
     the second for holes. To use different values write

     .. code-block:: python

        sys.add_line_defects([p1, p2], rho_GB, Sn_GB, Sp_GB, E=E_GB)
   * A continuum of states can be considered by omitting the energy argument
     above. The density of states can be a callable function or a numerical
     value, in which case the density of states is independent of the energy.


Computing the IV curve
........................

The computation of the IV curve proceeds as in the previous tutorials.  We show the code below::

  # Solve equilibirum problem first
  solution = sesame.solve_equilibrium(sys)

  # define a function for generation profile
  f = lambda x, y: 2.3e21*np.exp(-2.3e4*x)
  # add generation to the system
  sys.generation(f)

  # Specify applied voltages
  voltages = np.linspace(0, .9, 10)
  # Compute IV curve
  j = sesame.IVcurve(sys, voltages, solution, '2dGB_V')
  # rescale to dimension-ful current
  j = j * sesame.scaling.current

  # Save the computed IV data
  result = {'voltages':voltages, 'j':j}
  np.save('2dGB_IV', result)






Plotting system variables
..........................

The 2-dimensional solutions can be plotted with tools we describe more fully in :doc:`tutorial 4 <analysis>`.  As a preview, we list the commands for loading and plotting the electrostatic potential:: 

	sys, results = sesame.load_sim('2dGB_V_0.gzip')
	sesame.plot(sys, results['v'])


The output is shown below:

.. image:: GB_potential.*
   :align: center

.. note::
	As discussed more fully in Tutorial 4, quantities in Sesame are dimensionless by default.  The electrostatic potential shown above is dimensionless, scaled by the thermal voltage.  The ``scaling`` field of ``sys`` provides the relevant quantites needed to rescale quantities to dimension-ful form.



Spatial variation of material parameters
..........................................


.. seealso:: The example treated here is in the file ``2d_homojunction_withGB_nonuniform_mobility.py`` in the
   ``examples\tutorial4`` directory in the root directory of the distribution. 

Suppose we want to have a reduced mobility around the line defects compared to the rest
of the system.  To do so, we add another material which is defined in the region of non-uniform mobility.  It has the same properties as the original material, except that the mobility is not longer a scalar, but a function::

  # function defining region of reduced mobility
  xGB = 1.5e-4  # GB x-coordinate
  Lmu = .25e-4  # distance from GB over which mobility is reduced
  def reduced_mu_region(pos):
      x, y = pos
      return ((x < xGB+Lmu) & (x > xGB-Lmu) & (y > .1e-4) & (y < 2.9e-4))

  # function defining region of reduced mobility
  def my_mu(pos):
      muGB = 10
      x, y = pos
      # mobility varies linearly between GB core and Lmu
      return 10 + 310*np.abs((x-xGB)/Lmu)

  mat2 = {'Nc': 8e17, 'Nv': 1.8e19, 'Eg': 1.5, 'epsilon': 9.4, 'Et': 0,
         'mu_e': my_mu, 'mu_h': 40, 'tau_e': 10 * 1e-9, 'tau_h': 10 * 1e-9}

  # Add the material to the system
  sys.add_material(mat2, reduced_mu_region)

  sesame.plot(sys, sys.mu_e)
